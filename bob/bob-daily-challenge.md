# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

### Instructions
1. Review Bob's rules and return the appropriate response.
2. Once you have a passing test suite, add your code to your daily-challenges repo
3. Link us to your bob.js file on Slack.
